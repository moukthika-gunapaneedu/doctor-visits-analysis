# DoctorVisits: A Statistical Analysis

This project presents an in-depth statistical analysis of factors influencing the number of doctor visits using real-world healthcare data. The notebook explores variable relationships, tests key hypotheses, and applies various statistical techniques to derive insights.

## Key Objectives

- Understand what drives the frequency of doctor visits  
- Identify significant predictors such as age, income, health status, and insurance coverage  
- Apply both descriptive and inferential statistical methods  
- Interpret results to draw actionable healthcare insights

---

## Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation and Covariance Matrices  
- Linear Regression Modeling  
- ANOVA and t-tests  
- Chi-square tests for independence  
- Residual analysis and model diagnostics

## Sample Insights

- Income and insurance status were significant predictors of doctor visit frequency  
- Older individuals and those reporting poor health had higher visit rates  
- Certain variables failed normality tests, requiring non-parametric approaches
